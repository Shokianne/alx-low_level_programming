0- checks for uppercase character.<br>
1-function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). Returns 1 if c is a digit. Returns 0 otherwise <br>
2- function that multiplies two integers. <br>
3- function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_numbers(void); You can only use _putchar twice in your code <br>
4- function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void); Do not print 2 and 4. You can only use _putchar twice in your code. <br>
5- function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. <br>
6- function that draws a straight line in the terminal. Prototype: void print_line(int n); Only use _putchar function to print. Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed. The line should end with a \n. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n <br>
7- function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. <br>
8- function that prints a square, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_square(int size); Only use _putchar function to print. Where size is the size of the square. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line. Use the character # to print the square. <br>
9-prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. <br>
10-prints a triangle, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_triangle(int size); You can only use _putchar function to print. Where size is the size of the triangle. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line. Use the character # to print the triangle < br>
100- finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. <br>
101- function that prints an integer. Prototype: void print_number(int n); Only use _putchar function to print. Not allowed to use long, arrays or pointers and to hard-code special values
